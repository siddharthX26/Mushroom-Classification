# Mushroom-Classification
Mushroom hunting (otherwise known as "shrooming") is enjoying new peaks in popularity. Learn which features spell certain death and which are most palatable in this dataset of mushroom characteristics. And how certain can your model be?

Hi the following problem statement is take up from Kaggle.Link -> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification

The jupyter notebook is pretty simple we do some EDA to check out the columns and then check null values etc. and finally create a model.

On exploration of data you will find all the columns are categories and hence I have used is Random Forest beacuse splitting up of a tree based on categories will give the best information.

As a result we have achieved 100% accuracy on this . The data is pretty simple. Happy Learning!
